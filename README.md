# SOLID-typescript

## GOALS
- Get familiar with TypeScript
- Learn and apply the SOLID principles on small refactor exercises

### SOLID Principles
* [Single Responsibility Principle](0.S/readme.md) — Classes should have a single responsibility and thus only a single reason to change.
* [Open–closed principle](1.O/readme.md) — Classes and other entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* [Liskov Substitution Principle](2.L/readme.md) — Objects should be replaceable by their subtypes. See also design by contract. = polymorpism
* [Interface Segregation Principle](3.I/readme.md) — Interfaces should be client specific rather than general.
* [Dependency Inversion Principle](4.D/readme.md) — Depend on abstractions rather than concretions.
